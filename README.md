## Flask app
The flask app takes care of the routing and rendering of html pages. It also makes sure the logic works between patient login, doctor login, and scheduling.

## Mongo Client
#### Patient Login/Register:
- patient_exists to check if the user with the given username exists
- add_patient to register user
- patient_login to authenticate user
- applied fernet class from cryptography module for authentication security
- tests for CRUD operations located under the function in commented try-except

#### Doctor Login/Register:
- doctor_exists to check if the doctor with the given username exists
- NO REGISTER: Since it is assumed that the doctor is already in the hospital network
- doctor_login to authenticate doctor
- applied fernet class from cryptography module for authentication security
- tests for CRUD operations located under the function in commented try-except

#### Schedule CRUD: 
- Create schedule
- get_doctor_schedule by DoctorID
- update_schedule
- tests for CRUD operations located under the function in commented try-except

#### Appointments CRUD:
- book_appointment with doctor_id, patient_id, day, hour, reason
    - Add appointment to doctor schedule
    - create_appointment
        - add appointment to the appointments table, partial information
